# Application Setup

The guides in this section are only meant to set up Cloudbox specific settings into the various applications and are not meant to be a full setup for, or an introduction to, the workings of these apps.

You should go through this setup for all apps initially, EVEN IF YOU ARE NOT PLANNING ON USING ALL OF THEM.  For some of these apps, you will be prompted to create an admin account when you first load the app.  You should go through this now so that someone doesn't happen upon an app you haven't secured and and gain the ability to delete all your containers or access your files.
