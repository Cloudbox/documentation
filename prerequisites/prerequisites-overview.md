# Overview

A fully functional Cloudbox requires certain requirements to be met. This page aims to clear this up.

Cloudbox was designed around:

* installation on a remote [server](prerequisites-server.md).
* access via a personal [domain](prerequisites-domain-name.md).
* media on [cloud storage](prerequisites-cloud-storage.md).

This means that Cloudbox requires:

* a remote [server](prerequisites-server.md) with root-level access.
* a personal [domain](prerequisites-domain-name.md)
* a [cloud storage](prerequisites-cloud-storage.md) provider account.

Although Cloudbox and its tools can be set up without some of these requirements \[for example on a home server\], it is outside the scope of this wiki and support channels.
