# Plex

You'll need a [Plex](https://www.plex.tv) account.

Sign up for a free Plex account at [https://www.plex.tv/sign-up/](https://www.plex.tv/sign-up/), if you don't already have one.

It's easiest if you have a Plex account _even if you're not planning to use Plex_. The default `cloudbox` install assumes that you are using Plex, and without a Plex account in the settings, it will fail in various ways as it tries to install Plex and then things that depends on Plex. This can be worked around[\[1\]](prerequisites-plex.md#f1), but for now the simplest route is to sign up for that free account, and then disable Plex after install if you don't want to use it.

[**1**](prerequisites-plex.md#a1) Basically, run the `core` tag instead of the `cloudbox` tag, then run the app tags you want individually.
