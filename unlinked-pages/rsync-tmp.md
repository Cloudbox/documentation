\(work in progress\)

Useful for migrating server to server.

## Overview

1. Destination
   1. Dependencies
   2. Preinstall
   3. Login as user
   4. Setup and enable rsync server

```text
      sudo nano /etc/rsyncd.conf
```

```text
  Format:
  ```
  [rsync_name]
      path = /path/to/backups/as/specified/in/local/destination/in/backup_config.yml
      comment = Backup folder
      uid = seed
      gid = seed
      read only = no
      list = yes
  ```



  Example:
  ```
  [backup]
      path = /home/seed/Backups/Cloudbox/Cloudbox
      comment = Backup folder
      uid = seed
      gid = seed
      read only = no
      list = yes
  ```


  Start Rsync:

  ```
  sudo systemctl start rsync
  ```
```

1. Create backup folder.

   ```text
   mkdir -p /home/seed/Backups/Cloudbox/Cloudbox
   ```

2. Source
   1. Create SSH key

```text
  ssh-keygen


  ```
  âžœ ssh-keygen
  Generating public/private rsa key pair.
  Enter file in which to save the key (/home/seed/.ssh/id_rsa):
  Created directory '/home/seed/.ssh'.
  Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
  Enter same passphrase again:
  Your identification has been saved in /home/seed/.ssh/id_rsa.
  Your public key has been saved in /home/seed/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
  The key fingerprint is:
  SHA256:PLaFOPjdddFV2ePo6hRnctslaeWEq9wLnbD89/rkkVE seed@mediaserver
  The key's randomart image is:
  +---[RSA 2048]----+
  |          .o   oo|
  |         .. o .. |
  |      . .  . . .E|
  |     . * .  o .o.|
  |    . = S +=+*+o.|
  |     . = * *O++oo|
  |      . o o..o.+.|
  |         ..   ooo|
  |         ..   .+=|
  +----[SHA256]-----+
  ```
```

1. Send SSH key to Destination server.

   ```text
    ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa seed@ipaddress
   ```

   Type in your password to confirm.

   ```text
    /usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: Source of key(s) to be installed: "/user/seed/.ssh/id_rsa.pub"

    Number of key(s) added:        1

    Now try logging into the machine, with:   "ssh 'seed@newserveripaddress'"
    and check to make sure that only the key(s) you wanted were added.
   ```

2. Test rsync URL.

```text
   Format
   ```
   rsync -rdt rsync://user@newserveripaddress/rsync_name
   ```


   Example:
   ```
   rsync -rdt rsync://seed@1.2.3.4/backup
   ```
```

1. Setup backup config.

```text
   backup_config.yml

   Format:
   ```yaml
   rsync:
     enable: true
     destination: rsync://user@newserveripaddress/rsync_name
   ```



   Example:

   ```yaml
   local:
     enable: false
     destination: /home/{{user}}/Backups/Cloudbox/Cloudbox
   rclone:
     enable: false
     destination: whatever
   rsync:
     enable: true
     destination: rsync://seed@1.2.3.4/backup
   ```
```

1. Run backup.
2. Destination
   1. Verify local backup folder has backup tarballs.
   2. Run restore
