## 1. Destination

### Setup and Enable Rsync Server

```text
sudo nano /etc/rsyncd.conf
```

Format:

```text
[rsync_name]
    path = /path/to/backups/as/specified/in/local/destination/in/backup_config.yml
    comment = Backup folder
    uid = seed
    gid = seed
    read only = no
    list = yes
```

Example:

```text
[backup]
    path = /home/seed/Backups/Cloudbox/Cloudbox
    comment = Backup folder
    uid = seed
    gid = seed
    read only = no
    list = yes
```

Start Rsync:

```text
sudo systemctl start rsync
```

## 2. Source

### 1. Create SSH Key

ssh-keygen

```text
âžœ ssh-keygen
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/home/seed/.ssh/id_rsa):
Created directory '/home/seed/.ssh'.
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
Enter same passphrase again:
Your identification has been saved in /home/seed/.ssh/id_rsa.
Your public key has been saved in /home/seed/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
SHA256:PLaFOPjdddFV2ePo6hRnctslaeWEq9wLnbD89/rkkVE seed@mediaserver
The key's randomart image is:
+---[RSA 2048]----+
|          .o   oo|
|         .. o .. |
|      . .  . . .E|
|     . * .  o .o.|
|    . = S +=+*+o.|
|     . = * *O++oo|
|      . o o..o.+.|
|         ..   ooo|
|         ..   .+=|
+----[SHA256]-----+
```

### Send SSH Key to destination

```text
ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa seed@ipaddress
```

Type in your password to confirm.

```text
/usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: Source of key(s) to be installed: "/user/seed/.ssh/id_rsa.pub"

Number of key(s) added:        1

Now try logging into the machine, with:   "ssh 'seed@newserveripaddress'"
and check to make sure that only the key(s) you wanted were added.
```

### Test Rsync

Format

```text
rsync -rdt rsync://user@newserveripaddress/rsync_name
```

Example:

```text
rsync -rdt rsync://seed@1.2.3.4/backup
```

### Backup Config

backup\_config.yml

Format:

```yaml
rsync:
  enable: true
  destination: rsync://user@newserveripaddress/rsync_name
```

Example:

```yaml
local:
  enable: false
  destination: /home/{{user}}/Backups/Cloudbox/Cloudbox
rclone:
  enable: false
  destination: whatever
rsync:
  enable: true
  destination: rsync://seed@1.2.3.4/backup
```
