# Adding a Subdomain

Setup instructions are separated based on the DNS Provider you use.

## Cloudflare

Cloudbox will automatically add subdomain on Cloudflare and point it to the correct IP address.

{% hint style="warning" %}
_Make sure the Cloudflare API Key is filled in_ [_settings.yml_](../install-cloudbox/04-install-settings.yml.md)_\) and the e-mail address matches the one you have in your account profile._
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
_There may be some subdomains that you have to add in yourself if Cloudbox doesnâ€™t so it for you, such as the Cloudbox type ones \(eg `cloudbox`, `feederbox`, `mediabox`\)._
{% endhint %}

## Other Domain Hosting Sites
